# FWD_Advanced_Embedded_RTOS_Project
Earliest Deadline First (EDF) is a shecduling algorithm that adopts a dynamic priority-based preemptive scheduling policy, meaning that the priority of a task can change during its execution, and the processing of any task is interrupted by a request for any higher priority task.



In this project I design an EDF scheduler based on FreeRTOS kernel.
